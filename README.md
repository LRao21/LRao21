## A Little Bit About Me

    "I love stories!"  
  
  If you asked me to sum myself up in one line, that's what I'd choose. 

  If you asked me to sum myself up in one line, that's what I'd choose.

  Stories fascinate me because they're pieces of someone's life they chose to share, whether it's philosophy, adventure, advice, etc. They connect us in ways nothing else can. In high school, I spent a year   
  diving deep into mall design and visual elements, and my paper became a way to share that whole journey—a year of my life I'd poured into learning and breathing something completely new. At Rutgers, my 
  favorite memories aren't from lecture halls—they're from random bus conversations, early morning classes followed by Livi pancakes, and discovering that everyone has wildly different takes on dining hall food 
  (team Busch, by the way). Just like that paper, they're stories too! 

  What I love most about stories is that they live in the details. Someone chose that exact phrase, that specific example, that particular corner of a memory to share. There's so much thought packed into those 
  choices.

  I want to become a better storyteller through my code. Every project is unique because someone built it; their perspective shapes every decision, every function, every design choice. It's an expression of 
  their time and thought, which makes it a story too, in a way.

  As I get ready to graduate, I'm carrying all these stories with me into my next chapter. I want to be a software engineer who helps build things that create new stories and leave room for others to make their 
  own memories and stories. (Plus, learning cool frameworks and employable skills sounds pretty great too.)

  Right now, I'm diving into new technologies, and really just figuring it all out one step at a time. Eventually, I'll have figured it all out enough to make a good book, metaphorically speaking, or just a good   amount of clean code.
